## Web Design Principles
These are the 4 Pillars of Web Design

### Typography
Fonts are important.
Fonts are mainly divided into two main families: Serif and Sans-Serif.
These families are further divided into sub families.
For the Serif, the larger the difference between the thickest and thinest part of the letters of the font, the younger the font.
Serif - Stable, Traditional, Respectable
Sans-Serif - Sensible, Straightforward, Simple
In the letters of a font you are looking for open shapes, ample intercharacter spacing, unambigious forms and varying proportions.
Limit choosing multiple fonts. Just 2 is enough in a design.
The fonts should have similar mood and time era while having contrast in "Serif-ness" and weights.
Avoid Comic Sans, Kristen, Curlz, Viner, Papyrus and  Σψμβολ.


### User Interface Design
Manage attention with UI design. We manage:
- Hierarchy: Making the most important information to be conveyed first. We can use color and size
- Layout: How the web page is arranged. A length of block of text should not be too long or too short. Chop up the content into smaller pieces.
- Alignment: How you position the elements on the screen relative to each other. Reduce the number of alignment points.
- White Space: This refers to the empty space around elements. Space out the elements and do not pack them tightly to each other.
- Audience: Design for your audience.


### User Experience Design
When Designing your web page check the following:
- Simplicity
- Consistency
- Reading Patterns
- All platform design
- Do not use your power for evil
